## Description
The following repository is for an application that generates a ReadMe file for any upcoming project. The application is run in the terminal either using node index.js or npm start. Once run, the program will go through a series of questions that would make up each section of the ReadMe file. The information input to the terminal will then be saved and stored on the generated ReadMe after all questions have been answered. The ReadMe file further provides options for a license type that if selected will generate a badge at the top of the ReadMe file and will provide a link in the license section of the ReadMe. For further understanding of the application, please visit the GitHub repository and link to the video demonstration posted in the Links section of this ReadMe.
